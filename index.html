            <h3>What's depression?</h3>
            <p>Depression is not just feeling sad--it can make you feel hopeless, unmotivated, or worthless, or gain or
                lose weight rapidly. Depression is linked to insomnia or excessive sleeping, lack of energy, trouble
                concentrating, and suicidal thoughts or a desire to self-harm. It's one of the most common mental disorders,
                and affects many people our age, but it is treatable.<br><br>
                Depression is often correlated with a family history of depression, drug use, and high levels of stress.
                Many people with depression find a balance of therapy and antidepressant medication, although everyone's
                different and some things don't work for everyone in the same way. What's important is to keep trying.
                <br><br>While it's hard to self-diagnose, since everyone expresses symptoms differently and you might
                not show all of the well-known symptoms, having a baseline can be helpful. If you're worried you've got
                depression, you can progress through<span id = "go-to" class = "show">this simple test</span> to find out
                how urgent it is that you get help.<br><br>Please realize that we are not professionals! We got all of
                this information from the resources we listed for you and our personal experiences, and while we did our
                best to make sure it's accurate, you are the best judge of yourself! If you're worried about your mental
                health or feel like you're in a dangerous place, you should consider seeking out someone who is qualified
                to help you. Depression is a disease like any other, and a qualified professional is often the best place
                to go to get help for it. Start with the resources above and make sure to do your own research!<br><br>
                You many not need to continue treatment forever. Depression can be cured, and if you're on antidepressants
                now, you might not have to be forever.

            <h3>Help a friend!</h3>
            <p>
                It's difficult to instinctively know how to help someone. If you're worried your friend is depressed,
                you should talk to them--you probably know how best to ask them if they need help, if something has
                happened, or if they just want to talk. If your friend is expressing suicidal thoughts or a tendency to
                self-harm, sometimes the best thing to do is to tell their parents--this can feel like a breach of trust,
                but it might save their life. However, that should be a last resort--if you're seriously worried, don't
                wait, but talk to them before taking any really serious steps.<br><br>Depression is sometimes difficult
                even for a professional to diagnose--don't beat yourself up if you didn't notice at first, just be there
                for them now. Your friend needs support, and you are one of the best people to help them right now. You
                don't have to be the only support for your friend, either--try to get them to reach out to other people
                as well, since a support network is one of the best things to help pull someone out of a dark place. No
                matter what might have happened (if anything) to cause this, your friend needs you, and your support will
                be one of the best things you can do for them right now.
